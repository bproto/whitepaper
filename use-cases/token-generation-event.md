# Token generation event

A subdomain can be acquired underneath a parent domain. This subdomain can be locked to prevent new subdomains from being created underneath it. The owner can then run their own fundraising campaign \(ICO, IEO, STO, etc\) with the supply of ERC-20 compatible tokens assigned to that domain. These tokens can be generated for any domain with no coding or contracts needed. The token is directly associated with a domain in Butterfly, so it is easily searchable and usable by domain name. This naming convention for token issuance allows for searching, listing sites, and allows a token to be automatically added to wallets.
