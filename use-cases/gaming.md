A company obtains the domain “tradingcard.sports” and therefore has all the utility tokens for that domain. Those tokens can be sold to game players to create a subdomain for each athlete, for example, “tombrady. tradingcard.sports”. There will be a single owner of each player’s non-fungible token that can be sold or traded for other players. The player’s subdomain can be used to access stats and additional information about that athlete, or used as an asset in an online sports game. These trading cards can seamlessly integrate with other smart contracts and create whole new ecosystems and economies.
