# Proof-of-freedom

Freedom of expression is Butterfly’s forte and is one of the main reasons for its disruptive nature. A mobile application will be created to enable people to easily acquire a “.human” subdomain name and then use that domain as to create content for others to read. No person or organization can block your content, censor you, or cancel your account. You are the sole owner of everything that you create and possess. This will be the use case that we launch the platform with. It serves as a showcase for how the Butterfly platform can be used to benefit society.
