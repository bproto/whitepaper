# Github

The recent purchase of Github by Microsoft has revealed yet another excellent use case of Butterfly. The platform itself was designed to be decentralized, but developers need a way to discover and manage open source code. In a client-server environment with centralized control, naming repositories of code was a simple task. Wikipedia reports that as of June 2018 GitHub reports having almost 28 million users and 57 million repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world. Use cases like this abound, and the massive number of TLDs and subdomains are becoming easy to understand. We intend to release “.repo” as one of the first TLDs and quickly integrate a Git implementation. If only a small fraction of the 57 million repositories run on Butterfly, the “.repo” TLD will be extremely valuable.
