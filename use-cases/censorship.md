# Censorship

In instances of a website being continually blocked by a hostile state actor, the users have to continually keep track of the new website URLs to maintain access to the given site. The online company purchases the domain with the FQN “xyz.info” from a Butterfly auction and now owns it permanently. Their users can now consistently access the blocked website using the Butterfly browser extension by typing in the same value “xyz.info” every time. Consequently, Butterfly protocol eradicates any governmental censorship that has been administered thus far, and enables Butterfly participants to reap the benefits of decentralization and censorship-proof ecosystem.
