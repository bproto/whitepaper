# Fractional Ownership

## Type 1

Antiques can be well represented by non-fungible ERC-721 tokens. A Butterfly subdomain under the "antiques" TLD, for example, can be created for every physical antique item with the associated 721 token. The subdomain name could be a serial number of the antique item or a unique description of it. The antique owner can sell off fractional ownership by generating ERC-20 compatible tokens for the antique item. Each person interested in owning a portion of the antique item can purchase specific number of the associated ERC-20 compatible tokens. The fractional owners anticipate the physical item’s value increment over time and they can sell or trade their tokens to other parties. The owner of the antique item can sell it, at which time they prove their ownership with the ERC-721 token and transfer that token to the new owner.

## Type 2

A bar of gold can be registered by its serial number as a non-fungible ERC-721 token within Butterfly. Each bar would be created as a name under the “gold” TLD, for example “A444581.gold”. Assume that the bar is 1 kilogram - then 1000 ERC-20 compatible tokens would get created, each token representing 1 gram of gold associated to that specific physical bar. The ERC-721 token would be owned by the entity that has physical possession of the gold, and the ERC-20 compatible tokens would be distributed and owned by the various fractional owners. The ERC-20 compatible tokens could be sold and traded on a decentralized website created to specifically target gold exchanges, and a fractional owner could also simply send their gold to another user using an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask.
