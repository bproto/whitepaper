# Tokenomics

The native digital cryptographically-secured protocol token of the Butterfly protocol is a major component of its ecosystem, and is designed to be used solely within the network. The IEO process starts with the circulation of 100,000,000 BUTTERFLY TOKENS which have three main purposes to start with:

* Token owners can sponsor the creation of new TLDs
* Token owners receive an air drop of 15% of all ERC-20 compatible tokens for every TLD created

Once the BUTTERFLY TOKENS are distributed, the Governance smart contracts take over. This smart contract will own the root domain and will facilitate the creation of all future TLDs. Since the registrar is run as a DAO we need a mechanism to suggest new TLD names and to create them. This is where the BUTTERFLY TOKEN comes into play.
