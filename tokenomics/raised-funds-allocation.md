# Raised funds allocation

Butterfly will use a portion of the funds raised to invest back into the platform for marketing and development efforts. This includes development of add-on services on top of the Butterfly platform, including:

* client applications that allow users to browse to Butterfly domains including browser extensions, a Butterfly specific browser, a DNS Gateway, search engines
* a mobile app for publishing and viewing decentralized content \(this is the Butterfly app, which we can show a prototype of during the IEO sale\)
* enhancing our auction website
