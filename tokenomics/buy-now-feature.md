# Buy Now Feature

In addition to the uncapped auction functionality the subdomain owners can sell a domain that they own using the Buy Now feature. This feature lets an owner list that domain name for sale at a specific price in Ether.

The seller receives the proceeds directly into their wallet. The ERC-721 token is transferred to the buyer as a result of the transaction. Note that when selling a non-fungible 721 domain token \(letâ€™s use fantasy. sports as the example\), all ERC-20 compatible tokens for that domain that have already been sold or transferred to other people cannot be revoked. The entire model breaks if the 721 owner could pull back ERC-20s. People have already used those fantasy.sports ERC-20s to acquire subdomains, for example soccer.fantasy.sports. They have therefore also created ERC-20s for those sub-subdomains. You can't take ownership away from other people that have already started new economies.

The value of a domain being sold is determined by:

* The perceived value of the domain name
* How many ERC-20s remain with the ERC-721 token that get transferred to the new owner
* What subdomains have already been created off of the domain by other people
