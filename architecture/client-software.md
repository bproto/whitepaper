# Client Software

Multiple clients will be created for easy access into Butterfly: 

Browser extension: Allows users to browse using the new domain names and will also support loading apps that are fully stored in IPFS. The user will have to type in a keyword in the address bar such as “dw” to signify that they are browsing the new decentralized system. 

Dedicated browser: A separate browser install that will always use Butterfly and therefore will not require a keyword to be specified. 

DNS Server: A special DNS server will serve as a bridge into the decentralized web name system. A client OS can be configured to point at our server or a locally hosted DNS server, which will behave like a traditional DNS server. It will first look up the name that is being requested within the Butterfly system, and if not found it will look up the name as a traditional domain name on the internet. This client will be limited to names allowed by the current DNS system and as meant to make for an easier transition.
