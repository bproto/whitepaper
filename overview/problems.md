# Problems

Currently, state authorities and governing, regulatory bodies are in power to block and/or delete any online content they deem inapt. This is a major barrier in the current state of the Internet - when it comes to free access to information and concerns numerous industries, with one of them being media outlets, for example. No matter if we are talking about a social media channel, a major news portal, a niche investigative journalism website or a simple personal blog post page - governing officials in autocratic states have the ability to single-handedly block specific domains, so publishers are powerless in getting quality content to reach an interested audience. 

The current state of domain names remains dormant as the registrars, in the face of market-monopolizing corporations, never actually sell the domain name, but merely lease it to customers for a time period. This is why one has to renew the domain name they have personally acquired on an annual basis. This creates more issues in the face of domain-name parking, which itself creates space for speculation and brokering practices, all of which create inefficiencies. For instance, one might have been quick enough to snap up their perfect domain name but has somehow missed renewing it, which in turn would ruin their online presence as numerous brokers are constantly scouting for expired, sought-after domains, acquiring and selling them at a premium. While a business model in itself, this adds little to no value for what Internet domain name ownership is meant to be. 

Similarly, one of the major issues is the limited domain name extension availability, imposed by ICANN \(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\). This US-based non-profit organization has not been addressing Internet users’ and domain owners’ needs enough when it comes to domain name selection – only a handful of top level domain name extensions were available for many years, and some of those were restricted like .edu, .mil, .gov. This has severely limited opportunities of both personal and corporate Internet usage. As an example, suppose that someone operates a car rental business. It would be impossible under the current state of domain name registering to acquire carrentals.com, simply because it is either already taken and in operation or because it is valued, accordingly, at a vast amount of a purchase price. Ultimately, the same domain and all its subsidiaries would be owned by a single entity, thereby restricting any inclusions from other participants. 

Another reason the current Domain Name System is regarded as legacy technology comes from the limitation of characters available for the actual names of the domains and associated extensions. Current domain names can only contains the characters a-z, 0-9, and hyphens. The Butterfly Protocol opens up the use of most Unicode characters including symbols for Asian languages and even emojis. The example below is for the Chinese car manufacturer BYD Auto. It shows that one could create a domain name with a mix of emojis and Asian characters.

As mentioned earlier, it cannot be denied that the existing Domain Name System has created a specific business model in the face of domain name parking. Individuals are free to acquire a TLD, with no intent to utilize it, but solely to profit from its value by buying low and selling higher. This restricts users to obtain the desired domain, as far too few companies offer domain name registration. This creates a monopolized market, which economically is an unfair practice and one which Butterfly strives to extinguish. Domain name registrars will frequently offer costly brokering services in domain name acquisition, which destabilize market equilibrium.
