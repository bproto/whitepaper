# Overview

The moment a website address is entered into the browser, the computer automatically requests a Domain Name System \(DNS\) server to convert that request to a numerical value \(i.e. 987.654.321.00\), which, as a result, displays the website being requested for. Regrettably, these DNS servers are under total government jurisdiction, giving them the power to determine whether DNS requests should be undertaken or ignored. Even though this technique, known as centralized DNS, yields higher dependability and authenticity, it tolerates a substantial amount of government censorship, which is audaciously misemployed by exploitative countries. 

To make things even worse, on top of authoritarian government institutions using this approach to limit the people from voicing their thoughts, any government body can decide to put down any website, independent from their actions – legal or not. Simply put, governments can pull the plug of any “hostile” website, thereby further restricting the already depleting freedom of expression. 

It would hardly be far-fetched to state that many of today’s online users take Internet and online presence for granted with how easy it is to create a website for personal or corporate use. With the Internet as accessible as it has ever been, anyone can join the online community, either as a user or an operator. It is all too understandable as well with how effortless it is to acquire a domain name in minutes and set up an online page. Worth well over $4 billion and with more than 300 million websites, the Domain Naming industry is continuing to grow, but few realize how centralized it is.

It all stems from ICANN, who is solely responsible for distributing Top-Level Domains such as .com, .net, .org etc. extensions to name a few. The major domain name registrars GoDaddy, Bluehost, Hostgator, Namecheap and a few others have a firm grip on that domain name extensions that are offered, monopolizing the market with continuous renewal costs and limited domain name availability. 

Butterfly is here to bring the future of Internet domain name creation, acquisition and ownership – one with a decentralized nature, where individuals and enterprises are able to select a domain name that uniquely identifies them on the new internet, without having to stay within the current DNS restrictions of a limited set of top level domain name extensions, thanks to blockchain technology. 

While decentralized domain naming systems have been developing for a while, only a few match and address the industry’s challenges as thoroughly as Butterfly. Domain name owners have their domain infinitely, free of renewal costs, while the network employs a proprietary web-browsing extension to counter censorship and content blocking. 

Butterfly also aims at opening up economies under every domain name by streamlining the old-fashioned process. Therefore, each domain address can be employed for a plethora of functionalities such as Ethereum transactions, messaging, social media managing, etc. Butterfly will seamlessly integrate with IPFS and owners of domains will be able to point those domains to IPFS hosted sites for a completely decentralized system. Our initial integration with IPFS and Git is intended to show the power of Butterfly. As the world realizes that the decentralization of the Internet is a necessity, it will also recognize that a decentralized naming schema is a necessity as well.

The Butterfly Protocol enables individuals to suggest, sponsor and bid on the creation of new domain names and then receive a share of the tokens associated with that domain. The individual can then leverage those tokens to create subdomains, thus opening up endless new economies.
