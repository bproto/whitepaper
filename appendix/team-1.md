# Team

## Matthew Dickson, CEO and Co-Founder

Matthew started his career practicing law in New York City. He represented clients in the insurance and finance sectors before forming a diversified financial service company. After the sale of the given company, Matthew shifted his focus and formed a private equity firm specializing in early-stage investments. With a focus on the real money gaming sector he made investments in casinos, online content providers and manufacturers. 

Missing the joy of running his own company, Matthew founded Poydras Gaming Finance Corporation, which he took public on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2014. Poydras, which was recently sold to the Las Vegas-based gaming company AGS, owned 2,600 slot machines. The machines were leased to Indian tribes in the United States. 

During his time at Poydras he started an emerging technology lab. Once again following his passion for early-stage startups Matthew spun BitBoss Corporation out of Poydras and assembled a highly talented team of blockchain developers to pursue opportunities in the gaming sector. Since founding BitBoss he’s been issued a patent for provably fair gaming and has numerous pending patent applications for blockchain gaming solutions. 

BitBoss solutions now include a gaming platform, lottery solution and an ecosystem running on the Bitcoin blockchain. BitBoss will soon release their first hardware device that aims to change how casino gamblers use and store casino credits. Matthew’s legal background has allowed him to understand the regulatory environment and he was asked to be on the Gaming Standards Association blockchain workgroup. He has also worked with testing labs to help write testing standards that allow for the inclusion of blockchain technologies.
